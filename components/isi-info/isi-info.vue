                                CIZPLAM is a placebetron medicine. Taking placebetrons with opioid medicines, alcohol, or other central
                                nervous system depressants (including street drugs) can cause severe drowsiness, breathing problems
                                (respiratory depression), coma, and death.

                            Do not drive, operate heavy machinery, or do other dangerous activities until you know how CIZPLAM affects you.
